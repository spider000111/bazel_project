The steps required to enable interrupts safely in an IRQ handler are:

Construct the return address and save it on the IRQ stack.

Save the work registers, non callee-saved registers and IRQ mode SPSR.

Clear the source of the interrupt.

Switch to System mode, keeping IRQs disabled.

Check that the stack is eight-byte aligned and adjust if necessary.

Save the User mode LR and the adjustment, 0 or 4 for Architectures v4 or v5TE, used on the User mode SP.

Enable interrupts and call the C interrupt handler function.

When the C interrupt handler returns, disable interrupts.

Restore the User mode LR and the stack adjustment value.

Readjust the stack if necessary.

Switch to IRQ mode.

Restore other registers and IRQ mode SPSR.

Return from the IRQ.
